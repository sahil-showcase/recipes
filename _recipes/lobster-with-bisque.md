Step 1. Steam lobster to ensure the meat is tender than boiling. Refernce cooking times: 1 Lb = 9 mins, 1.5 lbs = 11 mins, 2 lbs = 12 mins, ...

Step 2. Lobster Stock.
Clarify Butter (Optional):
Melt unsalted butter over low heat, skim off the foamy milk solids, and reserve the clear butter for sautéing.
Sauté Lobster Shells:
Heat a wide pot on high with ~60 g clarified butter (or enough to coat the bottom).
Add 1,000 g lobster shells and cook until lightly browned (~5 minutes), developing fond on the pot.
Add Butter & Aromatics:
Reduce heat to medium and add 100 g cold, cubed butter; cook until it begins to brown (~3 minutes).
Push shells aside and add 600 g canned tomatoes (with juice); scrape the bottom to loosen fond for ~1 minute.
Stir in 240 g sliced carrots and ~15 g tarragon, cooking ~3–4 minutes.
Add Water & Simmer:
Pour in 4 quarts (~4 liters) water.
Bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer.
Simmer until the liquid reduces by about 25% (~25 minutes), scraping the bottom occasionally.
Strain & Further Reduce:
Strain out the shells (press or squeeze them if possible to extract extra flavor).
Double-strain if desired to remove small particles.
Transfer stock to a clean pot and rapidly reduce until you have ~1,500 g of stock (about 1½ quarts).
Cool quickly (e.g., over an ice bath). Store in the fridge (up to 3 days) or freezer (up to 3 months).

Step 3. Bisque.
Brown Additional Lobster Shells in Butter:
Heat a wide pot on high until it just starts to smoke.
Add 100 g clarified butter plus 625 g lobster shells.
Cook until shells turn golden brown (~8 minutes).
Deglaze with Armagnac/Cognac:
Turn off heat, add 125 g Armagnac (or Cognac).
Scrape the bottom with a flat wooden spoon to loosen fond.
Turn heat back to medium.
Add Aromatic Veggies:
Stir in 210 g diced onion, 125 g thinly sliced carrots, 140 g sliced mushrooms, and 90 g sliced leeks.
Incorporate Lobster Stock:
Pour in 1,500 g of the prepared lobster stock.
Scrape up any fond from the bottom, then bring to a boil.
Simmer with Herbs & Cream:
Add 3 sprigs thyme, 5 bay leaves, 10g tomato paste, and 315 g cream.
Lower heat to a gentle simmer and cook ~40–45 minutes (reduce by about one-third).
Strain & Press Shells:
Strain out the shells (press them if possible to extract flavor).
Double-strain into a clean pot, removing any solids.
Thicken with Rice & Reduce:
Add 50 g short-grain rice (e.g., sushi rice) to the pot.
Cook on high heat and skim off any foam.
Reduce until only ~850 g of liquid remains (~30 minutes).
Blend (with Rice) & Final Seasoning:
Transfer the hot bisque plus the softened rice to a blender; blend until smooth.
Add ~50 g whole butter, ~5 g lemon juice, and a splash of Cognac (to taste).
Continue blending until fully emulsified.
