Step 1. Brine the Duck:
Dissolve salt in 1 liter of water over medium heat.
Add aromatics (e.g., herbs, spices) and let sit for 5 minutes.
Add ice to cool the brine completely.

Step 2.Prep the Duck:
Remove the duck from the brine and rinse under cold water for 30 minutes.
Prick the duck skin all over with a sausage prick, wooden skewer, or small sharp knife.
Blanch the Duck:
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.
Using tongs, dunk the duck into the boiling water for 20 seconds, then transfer to ice water.
Repeat this blanching process once more (total of 2 times).

Step 3.Dry the Duck:
Place the duck crown side down in a bowl of coarse salt.
Air-dry the duck in the fridge for 24 hours.
Prepare for Cooking:
Rinse off the salt under cold water and pat the duck dry.

Step 4.Score the Duck Skin:
Gently score the skin without cutting into the meat.
Roast the Duck:
Place the duck on a wire rack over a tray. Roast in the oven at 200°C for 6 minutes.
Reduce the oven temperature to 140°C (284°F).
Pour hot duck fat or oil over the duck and roast, basting at intervals.
Cook to Temperature:
Check the internal temperature after 8 minutes; continue basting and roasting until it reaches 56°C (133°F).
Rest the duck outside the oven for 10 minutes (the internal temp should stabilize at 56°C).

Step 5.Make the Honey Glaze:
Heat honey, star anise, and Sichuan peppercorns in a hot pan.
Boil until golden brown, then remove from heat.
Add crushed garlic, orange peel, sage, and lavender. Let the flavors infuse.

Step 6. Glaze and Crisp the Skin:
Brush the honey glaze over the duck skin.
Finish by blow-torching or placing under a hot grill to crisp the skin.
