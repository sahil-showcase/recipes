Step 1. Prepare the Green Chutney:
Thoroughly rinse the coriander leaves and roughly chop them. Place them in a blender or small grinder jar.
Add green chilies, ginger, cumin powder, chaat masala, lemon juice, and salt.
Add 1-2 teaspoons of water and blend into a smooth chutney. Adjust water as needed, but avoid making it too thin.
Transfer the chutney to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Step 2. Prepare the Chicken Tandoori:
In a mixing bowl, whisk together yogurt, ginger paste, garlic paste, olive oil, and all the spices (turmeric, cumin, coriander, garam masala, paprika, chili powder, and salt).
Add the chicken pieces to the marinade. Coat well, ensuring all pieces are evenly covered.
Cover the bowl and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight (up to 24 hours). For a quick version, let the chicken marinate for 10 minutes.

Step 3. Cook the Chicken:
Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F). Line a baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack over it.
Remove the chicken from the marinade, shaking off any excess. Arrange the pieces on the wire rack.
Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and slightly charred. Use a meat thermometer to check that the internal temperature reaches 155°F.
