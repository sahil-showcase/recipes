Step 1. Prepare the Prawns:
Shell and devein the prawns, reserving the shells for the sauce.
Slice the prawn meat into 0.5 cm rounds.
Marinate the prawn pieces with a drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkle of salt, and a few marjoram leaves. Cover and refrigerate for 30–40 minutes.

Step 2. Make the Sauce:
In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the finely chopped carrot, celery, and onion. Sweat the vegetables for 5–10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft but not browned.
Add the reserved prawn shells and press them with a spoon to release their juices. Cook for 2–3 minutes.
Stir in the dashi powder and mix well. Add the chopped tomatoes and basil, and stir gently.
Add a handful of ice to the pan to enhance flavor extraction and bring the mixture to a boil. Let it simmer for 20–30 minutes.
Blend the mixture using a hand blender, then strain through a fine sieve to obtain a smooth, rich sauce.
Return the strained sauce to the pan and reduce it over medium heat until thick and creamy.

Step 3. Cook the Spaghetti:
In a large pot, boil salted water and cook the spaghetti until just shy of al dente. Reserve ½ cup of pasta water.

Step 4. Combine Pasta and Sauce:
Add the partially cooked spaghetti to the reduced sauce. Toss and cook for 3–4 minutes, adding reserved pasta water as needed to achieve a silky consistency. Serve with shrimp/prawns on top.
