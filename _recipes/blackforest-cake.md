Step 1. Prep Cake Pans: Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease three 8-inch cake pans with room-temperature butter and line the bottoms with parchment paper.

Step 2.Mix Dry Ingredients: In a stand mixer, combine cake flour, sugar, Dutch-processed cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

Step 3.Bloom Cocoa Powder: Mix ¾ cup hot brewed coffee with cocoa powder until smooth and fragrant.

Step 4. Prepare Wet Ingredients: Whisk together eggs, additional yolks, crème fraîche (or sour cream), and vanilla extract.

Step 5.Combine Batter:
Add butter and oil to the dry ingredients and mix to form a sandy texture.
Gradually incorporate half of the bloomed cocoa mixture.
Add the egg mixture, followed by the remaining cocoa mixture. Mix until the batter is smooth and glossy.

Step 6.Distribute Batter: Divide batter evenly into the prepared cake pans (about 550g each). Bake for 20 minutes, rotate pans, then bake an additional 10–12 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean.

Step 7.Cool Layers: Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then invert them onto a wire rack. Level the tops if needed.

Step 8.Cherry Syrup: Combine equal parts sugar and water. Add ½ cup halved, pitted cherries for flavor, and bring to a boil.
Muddle the cherries, simmer for 1 minute, then cool.

Step 9.Whipped Cream Frosting:
In a chilled bowl, whip 1½ pints heavy whipping cream, ⅓ cup powdered sugar, and 1½ tablespoons Kirsch (or vanilla) to stiff peaks.

Step 10.Prepare Cherries:
Pit and halve 2 cups of fresh cherries. Reserve a few whole cherries for garnish.
