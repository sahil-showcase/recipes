Step 1.Prepare the Lamb:
Trim two racks of lamb (1.5-2 lbs each) to remove excess fat, leaving about 1/8-inch.
Season both sides of the lamb generously with kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper.

Step 2.Sear the Lamb:
Heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking.
Sear each lamb rack (starting fat-side down) for 2-4 minutes per side until golden brown. Let the racks cool for about 5 minutes.

Step 4.Make the peppercorn sauce:
Deglaze the pan with white wine. Add in thinly sliced shallots. Add black peppercorns and powder. Reduce and add cream+butter to thicken.

Step 4.Prepare the Herb Crust:
In a skillet over medium heat, toast 1 cup of panko breadcrumbs in 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
Add 2 tablespoons of minced thyme, 6 minced garlic cloves, and 4 minced anchovy fillets (optional for umami).
Season with 2 teaspoons kosher salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper.
Cook until breadcrumbs are golden brown (about 5 minutes), then transfer to a shallow dish.
Mix in 4 tablespoons of minced parsley (increase for a greener crust) and 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.

Step 5.Coat the Lamb:
Brush the lamb racks generously with Dijon mustard on all sides. This acts as a glue for the breadcrumb mixture.
Press the breadcrumb mixture onto the mustard-coated lamb, ensuring even coverage on all sides.
Roast the Lamb:

Step 6.Preheat the oven to 300째F (150째C).
Place the lamb racks fat-side up on a baking sheet. Roast for 40-50 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 135째F (57째C) for medium doneness.
Let the lamb rest for 15 minutes before slicing.

Step 7.Make the blanched beets by simmering into boiling salted water until soft and cutting into medallions.
