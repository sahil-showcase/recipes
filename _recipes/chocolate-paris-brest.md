Step 1.Make the Praline Paste:
Toast hazelnuts, remove skins, and set aside 1/4 cup for garnish.
Cook sugar with a little water until caramelized. Coat hazelnuts in caramel and let cool.
Blend caramelized nuts with almond butter into a smooth paste. Set aside.
Prepare the Pastry Cream:

Step 2.Warm milk with vanilla. Mix sugar, cornstarch, and egg yolks until pale.
Temper the egg mixture by gradually adding warm milk, then return to the pot.
Cook until thickened, whisk in butter, and chill with plastic wrap directly on the surface.
Make the Choux Pastry:

Step 3.Heat water, milk, butter, sugar, and salt. Add flour, cook into a dough, and cool slightly.
Beat in eggs one at a time until smooth and pipeable. Pipe a 10-inch ring (3 concentric rings) on parchment.
Brush with egg wash, top with crushed hazelnuts, and bake at 425°F for 10 minutes, then 350°F until golden. Cool completely.

Step 4.Prepare the Mousseline Cream:
Beat softened butter and praline paste until smooth. Gradually whip in chilled pastry cream.
Add 2 tbsp cocoa powder and mix until fully incorporated. Chill until ready to use.
Make the Ganache Topping:
Heat cream and pour over chopped chocolate. Stir until smooth and let cool slightly.

Step 5.Assemble: Slice the choux pastry horizontally. Spread a thin layer of praline paste on the bottom half.
Pipe rosettes of mousseline cream on the base.
Cover the top with chocolate ganache.
Place the top layer of pastry on the cream. Dust with powdered chocolate.
