Step 1: Clarify the Butter (If Not Using Ghee)
Melt 225–250 g unsalted butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
As it simmers, you will see white foam rising to the top. Skim off the foam with a spoon and reserve it (some people use it for cooking other dishes).
Once the milk solids have sunk to the bottom and the butter is golden/clear, strain it through a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth into a heatproof bowl.
You now have clarified butter (also called ghee). Keep it warm.
(If you’d rather not clarify, you can use regular melted butter; just know clarified butter can yield a slightly crisper texture.)

Step 2: Make the Syrup
In a medium saucepan, combine sugar and water (3 cups sugar, 2 cups water).
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10–15 minutes.
You’re looking for a consistency where the syrup is thick but still pourable. (When a drop falls off your spoon slowly and forms a heavier drop, you’re close.)
Stir in lemon juice (and any optional honey/peel) and simmer for 1 more minute.
Remove from heat, cool the syrup to near room temperature.
Turkish-style baklava typically calls for hot baklava + cooled syrup to get that sizzle and crunch.
Tip: Some like a warm syrup over hot baklava. The main point is one should be hot, the other cool for that signature crispy result.

Step 3: Prep the Phyllo Dough
Defrost phyllo dough in the fridge (per package instructions).
Unroll the sheets onto a clean surface.
Cover with a slightly damp towel so they don’t dry out. (Re-dampen as needed.)

Step 4: Assemble the Layers
->Preheat your oven to 160°C (320°F) for a slower, crispier bake.
->You can bake at ~400°F (200°C) for ~30–35 minutes if you prefer a faster, higher-temp method, but many find a longer bake at 160°C for about 50–60 minutes yields extra-crunchy layers.
Butter your 9×13 inch (or similarly sized) baking pan.
Cut or fold the phyllo sheets to fit your pan, if needed.
Layering (Turkish-inspired approach with a slight Greek nuance):
Place 2 or 3 phyllo sheets in the pan. Brush the top sheet with clarified butter.
Repeat: another 2 or 3 sheets, then brush with butter again.
Continue until you’ve used around half the phyllo sheets (approximately 15–16 sheets total, or half the stack).
Add the nut filling:
Combine your chopped nuts (walnuts/pistachios) in a bowl. If you want Greek-style spicing, add cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg.
Sprinkle evenly over the phyllo. For extra flavor, you can flick a bit of butter over the nuts so they adhere and toast nicely.
Top Layers:
Continue layering 2 or 3 sheets at a time, brushing each set with butter, until you’ve used all remaining phyllo sheets.
For the top 6–8 layers, many bakers prefer brushing every single sheet to ensure the top puffs and crisps nicely.
Rest before cutting (Optional but helpful):
Let the assembled (but unbaked) baklava rest for ~30 minutes. The phyllo soaks up the butter, becomes slightly more pliable, and is easier to cut neatly.


Step 5: Cut and Bake
With a very sharp knife, cut the baklava into your desired shapes:
Traditional diamonds: Cut lengthwise into 4–5 strips, then diagonally across.
Squares/rectangles: Simply cut lengthwise and crosswise.
Drizzle any remaining warm clarified butter over the top to ensure all corners are nicely coated.
Place in the preheated oven at 160°C (320°F).
Bake for 50–60 minutes, or until golden brown.
If you prefer a quicker method, you can bake at 200°C (400°F) for about 30–35 minutes, but watch closely so the top doesn’t scorch.


Step 6: Syrup Soak
Once the baklava is deep golden and crispy on top, remove from the oven.
Immediately pour the cooled (or lukewarm) syrup over the hot baklava. (Listen for the sizzle!)
Let it rest for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour so the syrup can fully soak in. Some people wait overnight, but you can definitely enjoy once it’s cooled and the layers have had time to absorb the syrup.
